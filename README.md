# 🧠 Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Deep Learning** repository!  
This is a collection of notebooks, experiments, and mini-projects I created while learning and practicing **Deep Learning concepts** — from the fundamentals to more advanced topics like CNNs, RNNs,Transformers, and Transfer Learning.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

Through this repository, my main objectives were to:

- **Master PyTorch** by building and training models from scratch  
- Understand the **core theory and intuition** behind neural networks  
- Gain hands-on experience with **different architectures** (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)  
- Learn how to **debug, tune, and visualize** training progress  
- Apply **transfer learning** and model optimization in practice

## 🧪 Example Projects

- 🖼️ **Image Classification** using CNNs (MNIST, CIFAR-10)
- 🕒 **Sequence Prediction** using RNN/LSTM
- 🔍 **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet)
- 📊 **Visualization of Training Metrics**
